With the rise in cyberattacks, the Nigerian government and regulatory bodies have introduced measures to safeguard businesses and consumers. Staying compliant with these regulations is critical for protecting sensitive data, maintaining customer trust, and avoiding penalties. Here’s a detailed look at the cybersecurity regulations Nigerian businesses must understand in 2024.</p>
